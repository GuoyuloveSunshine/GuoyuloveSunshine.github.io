We present CapPlanner, a hierarchical motion control and planning system which can do long-range locomotion control and planning according to the learned traverse capability of the robot in different topologies. It consists of two layers, the bottom-level controller computes the trajectory of the body and the feet according to the terrain, local target and current feetsâ€™ positions. Besides, it controls the motors to track the calculated trajectory.
The top-level controller learns the traverse ability of the robot with its bottom-level controller by simulating locomotion tasks on various terrains and in different topologies. Hence our CapPlanner can guide the robot to reach a long-term destination with a much higher success rate.

### System Framework

> Overall framework of CapPlanner. TLC learns the traverse ability of BLC-robot system and give commands that conform to BLC-robot system. The blue elements run in simulation, the yellow elements run in reality, and the green elements run in both simulation and reality.
