## Academic

I am currently a master student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University majored in Automation & Control Engineering. My research interest is about legged robots. And I am in [RL2 Lab](https://gaoyue.sjtu.edu.cn) of the AI Institute of SJTU. I am doing research about legged robots on the following topics:

- Locomotion planning and control for legged robots.
  
- Reinforcement learning based motion control for legged robots. 

- Traverse capability based path planning for legged robots.

## Teaching

I have been doing a part-time job as an informatics competition coach in Shanghai Jiao Long Academy. My job is to teach middle school students classical algorithms and programming in Python/C++ to participate in informatics competitions.

## Open Source Community

I am proficient at developing in python and good at C/C++ and ROS. I will be very happy to contribute to Open Source projects about robot perception, planning and control.
