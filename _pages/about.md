## Academic

I am currently a master student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University majored in Information Engineering. My research interest is about robot arms and manipulation. And I am in [RL2 Lab](https://gaoyue.sjtu.edu.cn) of the AI Institute, SJTU. I am doing research about robot manipulation on the following topics:

- Motion planning and control for robot arms.
  
- Reinforcement learning based manipulation for robot arms. 

- Human like imitation learning based manipulation for robot arms.

## Teaching

In 2023, I have been doing a teaching assistant in SPEIT SJTU. My work is about help the professor teach undergraduate students in mobile robotic classes.

## Exchange

From 08/2021 to 09/2022, being proficient in French, I have been to ENSTA Paris for over one year as a exchange graduate student. In ENSTA, I took some courses of domain Information and Communication Sciences and Technologies and participated in the [U2IS Lab](http://u2is.ensta-paris.fr/index.php?lang=en) and was mentored by [Sao Mai NGUYEN](http://nguyensmai.free.fr/Home.html).I have developped a good acknoweledgement about humain robot interaction and have done some researches on motion retargeting.

## Internship
In 2020, I developped a three month internship in the company Air Liquide, there, I worked for the computer science department and tried to solve a distribution problem by using the clustering algorithm.
