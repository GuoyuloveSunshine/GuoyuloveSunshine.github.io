## Academic

I am currently a master student in Shanghai Jiao Tong University majored in Information Engineering. My research interest is about robot arms and manipulation. And I am in [RL2 Lab](https://gaoyue.sjtu.edu.cn) of the AI Institute of SJTU. I am doing research about robot manipulation on the following topics:

- Motion planning and control for robot arms.
  
- Reinforcement learning based manipulation for robot arms. 

- Human like imitation learning based manipulation for robot arms.

## Teaching

I have been doing a teaching assistant in SPEIT SJTU. My work is about help the professor teach undergraduate students in robotic classes.

## Experiments

I am proficient in French. And I have been to UNSTA PARIS for over 1 year as a exchange graduate student. I have done some works about robot motion retargeting.
